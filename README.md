# GIFTest (work in progress, stay tuned!)
Creates a GIF from a source of image files from a specified directory, or batch processing of subdirectories in a specified parent directory.
Can specify: directory where sources image files are, name of gif and speed of animation in ms.

For MacOS: Goto Python.org, download and install, then run main_mac.py.  If it gives you an error trying running the following command in a terminal:
python -m pip install Pillow

Remarks: When asked, "include all subdirectories?" please answer with true or false.

The reason this script is named GIFTest, is because this is my first python program with a specific purpose - I was testing to see if I had gained enough proficiency to write a working program.
